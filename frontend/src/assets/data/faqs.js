    question: "What should I do if water is leaking through my ceiling?",
    content:
      "Water leaks in any home can cause lots of damage, from rotting wood to peeling paint. Mould thrives in moist environments, so it is important to find the cause of the leak as soon as possible to prevent further damage from being caused. If you notice a water leak, catch the drips in a bucket. Remember to moveall valuables away from the water damage. If the ceiling begins to bulge, punch a small hole in the ceiling to let the water drain out. This can prevent the ceiling from collapsing. In the meantime, call a plumber to get to the root of the problem as soon as you can â€“ water damage can get structural quicker than you might imagine, so it makes financial sense to address the situation promptly.
